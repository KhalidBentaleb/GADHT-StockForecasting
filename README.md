## üìå Overview
GADHT is a hybrid forecasting framework that combines:
- **CEEMDAN decomposition** for adaptive multi-scale signal separation,  
- **Generative pretraining via IMF masking and reconstruction**,  
- **Energy-weighted hierarchical Transformers** for robust financial time series prediction.  

The model is evaluated on stock price data with daily OHLCV features, extended to multi-step forecasting horizons (1, 5, and 10 days ahead), and benchmarked against recent baselines.
